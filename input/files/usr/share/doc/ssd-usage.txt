SSD Usage with this k3s cluster:

To use an SSD with this system:
1. Attach your SSD to the Raspberry Pi
2. Run the command: prepare-ssd /dev/sdXY (replace with your actual device)
3. Reboot the system

The system will automatically detect and mount the SSD on /mnt/ssd
and use it for /var/lib to improve container performance.

Only drives with a .ssd marker file will be used.
